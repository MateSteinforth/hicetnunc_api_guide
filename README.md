# What is Hic Et Nunc?

Hic et nunc is a decentralized NFT marketplace built on the Tezos blockchain. That sounds complicated let's unpack:

### Decentralized System

A decentralized system is one where one entity does not have full control over the decision making, additions and maitenance of the system. A decentralized system is inherently communal, serving groups of interconnected relevant parties that want to transact with trust. In many cases decentralization is impossible to reach, a best attempt at a utopian life. 

### Blockchain 

A blockchain is a database that is built specifically to run on decentralized p2p networks and requires a set of 'checks and balances' to read, write and interact with. There are many different types of blockchains, some of them store financial data like Bitcoin. Others like Ethereum, Tezos and IPFS store files, application data, etc. 

Depending on the implementation, a blockchain can be both decentralized or centralized. Decentralization lends itself to certain ideas and for now the most common implementation of a decentralized blockchain is a cryptocurrency.

### Cryptocurrency 

A cryptocurrency is a means to transact value on a digital platform not owned by a single nation state or government entity. If you are curious as to why that might be needed, you might be in the wrong place.

### NFT

An NFT stands for 'non-fungible-token' and was originally created as one of many smart contract types to use on the Ethereum network. Unlike a currency, an NFT is a more of a receipt that uses a private key to verify your assocation to certain files, items and events that happen on the blockchain. It is your digital backpack that lets you store and collect moments and digital blockchain goods. 

### Hicetnunc

Hicetnunc is a open source movement that created the Tezos NFT specification called an 'OBJKT.' Unlike other NFT platformns, hicetnunc uses Tezos, which is a proof-of-stake blockchain with significantly less fees and environmental impact caused by mining. Hicetnunc.xyz allows you to create, collect and interact with the Tezos blockchain.
